# dcss-lua-fab
some lua scripts as qol for the DCSS game

and much credits to https://github.com/HilariousDeathArtist/DCSSConfigFile, thanks for sharing some code!

IT WORKS :
* sendkey 'zu' over skeletons or corpses
* set your runspeed to your slower minion (disabled while enemy in sight)
* sendkey 'aa' when worshipping yred

HOWTO : 
for now, you must manually copy the contents of the lua files to your .rc from the dcss website
then read the first commented line to bind a macro that runs the function


TODO :
* handle other animate skill
