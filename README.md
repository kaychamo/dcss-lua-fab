# dcss-lua-fab
some lua scripts as qol for the DCSS game

and much credits to https://github.com/HilariousDeathArtist/DCSSConfigFile, thanks for sharing some code!

IT WORKS :
* sendkey 'zu' over skeletons, then call 'o' key (autoexplore)
* sendkey 'ctrl+e' when you got a minion so you run at its max speed while no ennemy are in sight


HOWTO : 
for now, you must manually copy the contents of the lua files to your .rc from the dcss website
then read the first commented line to bind a macro that runs the function


TODO :
* deal with food (move, butcher...)
* totally replace 'o' key (autoexplore)
* handle other animate skill
* handle yred
